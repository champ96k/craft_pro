Here are the release notes for the changes:

  Firebase crashlytics has been implemented to help improve the stability and reliability of the app. This will allow us to identify and fix any issues that may arise in the future. [Dev side]
  An emulator device check has been added to the app. If the user is using the app on an emulator, they will not have access to the app. This is to ensure the app is only being used on legitimate devices.
  The JusPay plugin has been implemented to improve the payment process within the app. This will allow users to make payments more easily and securely.
  The app update bypass issue has been addressed. Users should now be able to update the app without any issues.
  The API call session key expire condition has been checked and addressed. If the session key expires, the user will be logged out and redirected to the login screen.
  The app log has been disabled on production to improve the performance and privacy of the app. This will ensure that sensitive information is not logged on production servers.
